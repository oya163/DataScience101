# Data Science 101

We formed a group to discuss and learn about the data science. We meet every alternative days to work on Kaggle problem. We go through the theoretical and practical knowledge required to help us prepare for data science internship.

- Titanic
  - Kaggle Dataset kernel
  - Basics of machine learning
  - Learned about data preprocessing and data visualization


- Movie Sentiment Analysis
  - Text preprocessing (Removal of punctuations, html tags)
  - Creation of dataset in proper csv formatted file
  - Usage of NLTK for tokenization for TfidfVectorizer
  - Machine Learning algorithms
    - Logistic Regression
